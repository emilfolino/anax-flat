####Q: It has been reported that the team might be looking to activate Dion Lewis in the near future. Has there been any chance to his status?

_BB: There hasn't been. Yeah, we'll see how it goes here as we get closer to the game._

####Q: Have you been encouraged by the progress Dion Lewis has made out on the practice field?

_BB: Yeah, he's working hard. Yeah, he's working hard. I think this is what he needs; to be around football. Rehabbing and running up hills and doing pushups and all that, I mean it's great, but that's not playing football. He's gotten a lot of good football snaps over the last however many days it has been. Yeah, it's good._

####Q: What's the biggest indicator to you that a player coming off of an injury is ready to return to game action?

_BB: Yeah, I think you just have to go by what you see. I mean the fact that he's been cleared medically tells you that he is to a certain point. Then it's a question of how he looks on the football field. Some of that is relative to what you remember from him in the past. Some of it is relative to what is out there that he's competing against._
