**Q: It has been reported that the team might be looking to activate Dion Lewis in the near future. Has there been any chance to his status?**

BB: There hasn't been. Yeah, we'll see how it goes here as we get closer to the game.

**Q: Have you been encouraged by the progress Dion Lewis has made out on the practice field?**

BB: Yeah, he's working hard. Yeah, he's working hard. I think this is what he needs; to be around football. Rehabbing and running up hills and doing pushups and all that, I mean it's great, but that's not playing football. He's gotten a lot of good football snaps over the last however many days it has been. Yeah, it's good.
