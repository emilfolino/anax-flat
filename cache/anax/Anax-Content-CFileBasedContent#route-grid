<p><strong>Q: It has been reported that the team might be looking to activate Dion Lewis in the near future. Has there been any chance to his status?</strong></p>

<p>BB: There hasn&#8217;t been. Yeah, we&#8217;ll see how it goes here as we get closer to the game.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Have you been encouraged by the progress Dion Lewis has made out on the practice field?</strong></p>

<p>BB: Yeah, he&#8217;s working hard. Yeah, he&#8217;s working hard. I think this is what he needs; to be around football. Rehabbing and running up hills and doing pushups and all that, I mean it&#8217;s great, but that&#8217;s not playing football. He&#8217;s gotten a lot of good football snaps over the last however many days it has been. Yeah, it&#8217;s good.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What&#8217;s the biggest indicator to you that a player coming off of an injury is ready to return to game action?</strong></p>

<p>BB: Yeah, I think you just have to go by what you see. I mean the fact that he&#8217;s been cleared medically tells you that he is to a certain point. Then it&#8217;s a question of how he looks on the football field. Some of that is relative to what you remember from him in the past. Some of it is relative to what is out there that he&#8217;s competing against.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Is it safe to say that seeing snaps from him in a game mean a lot more than just observing a player in practice?</strong></p>

<p>BB: Yeah, that&#8217;s probably true. Although I think it depends on how many snaps we&#8217;re talking about. We see a lot more snaps in practice than possibly we would see in the game. So just picking out numbers, I have no idea, but you might have 15 game snaps. You might have 75 practice snaps. Do you ignore those 75 plays that you&#8217;ve seen for a handful in a game or vice versa? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p><strong>Q: What can Dion Lewis add to this offense?</strong></p>

<p>BB: I don&#8217;t know. We&#8217;d have to put him out there and see.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Has James White shown enough this season to be able to continue to contribute once Dion Lewis is able to return to game action?</strong></p>

<p>BB: I think James White is good; is a good player. What he does is good. Could somebody do it better? I mean I don&#8217;t know. But it would take quite a bit I would say based on where he is and how consistent he&#8217;s been with what he&#8217;s done. It would take somebody playing pretty good to be better than him.</p>

<p><strong>Q: Since Marshawn Lynch retired have you seen the Seahawks change the way they play offense at all with perhaps more of an emphasis on the passing game?</strong></p>

<p>BB: No, I think their offense is the same. The play-calling, you know, I mean you&#8217;d have to ask them. I&#8217;m not really sure, but no, I would say their offense is their offense. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a lot of new plays or a lot of plays been thrown out that we saw before that we haven&#8217;t seen since. I wouldn&#8217;t put it in that category at all. I think they have a good system. It&#8217;s a well-balanced system. They run the ball with the quarterback under center. They run the ball a lot out of shotgun. Those are kind of two different but complementary-type running games. Same thing with the passing game; they throw the ball under center. They throw the ball with the quarterback in the shotgun. They run play-action. They run drop-backs. They run misdirection plays. They take shots down the field. They throw a lot of catch-and-run plays so they&#8217;re a well-balanced offense. They can hurt you a lot of different ways.</p>

<p><strong>Q: When you use a two running back formation how does that stress the defense? What kind of a challenge is that for them to matchup with?</strong></p>

<p>BB: Well, it depends on what the backs do. But if they both carry the ball then it gives you two guys that can carry the ball instead of one, as opposed to having say a tight end back there or somebody like that. If you free release one of those two guys then which guy is it? It depends on who the players are. I mean I don&#8217;t know. Who&#8217;s the other person back there?</p>
